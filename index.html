          <div class="about">
          <p>Sri Lanka is an Indian Ocean island located southeast of India. The country is noted for its broad plains, towering mountain peaks, tea plantations, and stunning temples. Ceylon was the name given to the island in the past, and it is still used to refer to Sri Lankan tea. In comparison to India, the country is relatively wealthy. Despite this, one-fifth of the population lives in poverty. Sri Lanka's economy is mostly based on the export of tea, coffee, clothing, rubber, and coconuts. Tourism has become an increasingly important source of revenue in recent years. The island's attractiveness is attracting an increasing number of visitors. This is due in part to lower aircraft ticket prices, but also to improved visitor facilities.</p>

               <h3>Map of Sri Lanka</h3>
               <p>Most vacations begin in Colombo, which is located in the southwest corner of Sri Lanka's map. This city provides a glimpse into Sri Lanka's history, with pre-colonial structures as well as colonial structures from the Dutch and British eras. Decolonisation did not stifle economic progress, as seen by modern skyscrapers.</p>
               <br>
               <p>This port town has existed since the dawn of time and was named the country's capital in 1815. Sri Jayewardenapura Kotte (Kotte) was designated as Sri Lanka's new capital in 1982. Colombo now serves as the country's commercial capital, while Kotte serves as the country's official administrative capital, as well as the site of the country's parliament.</p>

             <h3>History</h3>
             <p>Since prehistoric times, Sri Lanka has been populated. The oldest human remains discovered there stretch back about 125,000 years. The Weddas lived on the island in prehistoric times. 
                The Tamil gradually made their way from South India to the north of Sri Lanka throughout the European Middle Ages, where they created a monarchy in the 11th century. The forefathers of the Singalese, Sri Lanka's largest ethnic group, are said to have arrived from North India in the 5th or 6th century B.C. They coexisted with the Tamils, albeit their relationship was complicated and not always peaceful. The Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in Sri Lanka in 1505. They were there until 1658. The Dutch Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC) was founded in 1602, and the Dutch sailed to Sri Lanka as well. In 1638, the monarch of Kandy approached the VOC for assistance, requesting the Dutch's assistance in fighting the Portuguese. In exchange for an exclusive trade deal, the VOC gave this assistance.</p>
             <br>
             <p>The VOC's influence swiftly grew, and by 1658, the entire island of Sri Lanka was under Dutch control. Both parties, however, did not adhere to the agreements reached. The country underwent significant modernity, notably as the construction of canals for the transportation of goods, but this was aided in part by persecution. 
                The Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim populations were unaffected by the Protestant Dutch, but Catholics and the last Portuguese colonists were targeted. Furthermore, the people was forced to pay larger taxes to the Dutch colonists than to the previous Portuguese authorities. Sri Lanka was invaded by the British in 1796, and in 1802 it became a British colony known as Ceylon. Sri Lanka gained independence on February 4, 1948, under the name Dominion Ceylon, which was changed to Sri Lanka in 1972. A brutal civil conflict erupted in Sri Lanka between Tamils and Sinhalese from 1983 to 2009, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.</p>

        <div class="content-wrapper">
           <h3>Climate and optimal travel time</h3>
           <p>Sri Lanka's climate is separated into two regions: the west and the east. Western Sri Lanka has a very consistent climate, with typical temperatures hovering around 30 to 32 degrees Celsius throughout the year. The temperature decreases to 22 to 25 degrees Celsius at night. Rain chances, on the other hand, can vary greatly. 
              It is therefore preferable to avoid the rainy season when planning a trip to Sri Lanka. There are two rainy seasons in the western half of the country each year: April to June and September to December. Between July and August, the weather is drier, but there is more rain than in January, February, and March. The best time to visit the west of Sri Lanka is between January and March. </p>
           <br>
           <p>The highest temperature in the eastern portion of Sri Lanka is likewise consistent, ranging from 27 degrees Celsius in January to 33 degrees Celsius from March to August. The rainy season in the east of the country runs from October to January, although it does not in the west. As a result, the best time to visit the eastern portion of Sri Lanka is between February and September. 
              Travelers who want to see both the eastern and western sections of the country can simply combine the best travel times for both areas of the country. February to March would be the greatest time to visit Sri Lanka as a whole.</p>
