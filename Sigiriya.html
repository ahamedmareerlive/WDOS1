    The Lion's Rock, commonly known as Sigiriya, is a rock castle and palace in Sri Lanka's Matale region. Gardens, ponds, and other constructions surround this ruin. King Kassapa erected Sigiriya, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
    Sigiriya is an old rock castle and palace that stands magnificently 660 feet straight up, erected by King Kashyapa between 473 and 495. It's in Sri Lanka's central province, near the town of Dambulla, in the northern Matale district. The Lion's Rock, also known as Sigiriya or Sinhagiri, is reached by ascending 1200 steps to the Lion Rock Fortress on top of Sigiriya. There are various platforms that break up the steps and provide a rest stop if needed. Today, the Sigiriya rock castle is a well-known Archeological Treasure, and in 1982, UNESCO designated it as a World Heritage Site under the name "Ancient City of Sigiriya Sri Lanka.

    <p>
      Sigiriya has a rich and illustrious history. A quarrel between two brothers resulted in the formation of the rock.
      King Kashyapa erected the enormous rock fortress of Sigiriya. This magnificent structure was built by King Kashyapa to protect himself from his brother, King Mogallana.
      A sad occurrence is linked to the Sigiriya rock. King Mogallana had been the heir to the throne, but King Kashyapa had seized control by force.
      
      King Kashyapa was concerned that his brother might return to claim the throne for himself.
      
      As a result, he erected this rock fortress to protect himself. He didn't want his brother to intrude in any way.
      
      The technology used in the construction of the fort is outstanding.
      The frescoes on the Sigiriya rock are vibrant. However, Moggallana defeated Kashyapa, and the rock castle was destroyed as a result.
      
      It was previously a Buddhist monastery, and after the palace was demolished, it was converted back to a Buddhist monastery.
      
      Europeans discovered Sigiriya later, in 1831. Jonathan Forbes, a British army major, discovered Sigiriya on his route from Polonnaruwa. 
      Many historians and archaeologists began digging this rock fortress, and it was through these digs that the rock's glory was revealed. A trip to the summit of the rock reveals a fortress complete with gardens and parks.
      
      Sigiriya is a large rock that was created for protection, and the technology that was used to construct it is impressive.

    Beautiful women are depicted in the Sigiriya artworks. The drawings are thought to be reflections of the lovely women that resided in King Kashyapa's court.
    The women were designed to look like Apsaras. Tourists are drawn to the paintings because of the woman's facial expressions and the use of color.
    The women in these drawings all have beautiful three-circled tattoos around their necks, which is the most common feature.
    
    It denotes that the women are Queen Kashyapa's. They appeared unearthly and were a representation of Kasyapa's grandeur.
    
    The drawings are similarly similar to the Gupta style of art found in India's Ajanta Caves.

   <p >The pattern is designed so that rectangular pools can be found on both sides of the roadways leading to the western entrance.
    Limestone fountains stand in front of the pools.
    The technology used is quite advanced, and it's difficult to believe that such technology existed in ancient times.
