            <h1>Hiriketiya Beach in Sri Lanka</h1>
            <img src="img/Hiriketiya Beach in Sri Lanka.jpg"/>
            <p>
              Hiriketiya Beach, also known as Hiri Beach, is growing increasingly popular due to its waves. Some claim it's on its way to becoming Sri Lanka's surfer's paradise! With its deep palm tree forest and proximity to trendy eateries where you can grab a fantastic breakfast, it's simple to see why the horseshoe bay is so popular. Surfers from all over the world flock to Hiriketiya, bringing with them a surfy, bohemian feel that can be felt throughout the town.
              Despite the fact that the ocean is crowded, there is still space to swim or watch surfers catch the best wave of the day from the shore. The greatest thing you can do is rent a board and join them by taking a lesson at one of the beach's surf schools. The best months to visit are November to April (better for smaller, beginner waves) and August to October (larger waves for more expert surfers).

            <img src="img/Arugam-Bay-surf.jpg"/>
            <p>
              Arugam Bay, on Sri Lanka's east coast, is the best of the country's surfing beaches, and it's growing in popularity among surfers worldwide. In fact, international surfing events are being held here.
              Many surfers make Arugam Bay their home during the peak surfing season because the waves are consistently good (April to September). Despite its fame, the area retains its isolated beachy vibe, complete with wooden huts flanking the beach and palm tree forests. Close to the center, however, there are some great restaurants, cafes, and bars with a wide range of international cuisine and bohemian outdoor terraces. Arugam Bay is close to several of Sri Lanka's best national parks, including Yala and Udawalawe. As a result, there are numerous tour companies that offer vehicle safaris where you can see elephants, monkeys, and even the elusive leopard! The optimum time to visit is from April to September (please note that certain hotels will be closed outside of this prime surf season).

            <img src="img/Mirissa.jpg"/>
            <p>
              Mirissa welcomes a diverse range of visitors, from experienced surfers to sunbathers. Mirissa Beach is the most well-known of all the beaches in Sri Lanka; it's noted for its outstanding surfing, restaurants, bars, and snorkeling. 
              The beach itself is 2 kilometers long, with the magnificent Parrot Rock in the middle. The finest snorkeling location is on the left side of the rock. Surfers of all ages and skills can be found on the right side, enjoying the magnificent waves. While visiting Mirissa Beach, a trip to Parrot Rock (where you won't find any parrots!) is a must. The rock, which is located in front of the beach, provides excellent views of the palm tree forest below. Because the rock is out at sea, you'll need to check tidal times to ensure a safe crossing. The best months to visit are November to April and August to October.
